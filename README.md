elastic-google-io-slides
========================

A mod of google html5 slides that scale down with css3 transform if view is smaller than the slide instead of cropping.

Check the demo at http://francescolaffi.github.com/elastic-google-io-slides/template.html

This mod let you embed the slides in other sites using an iframe. The slides are only scaled down, not up.

The only changes are in js/slides.js and in themes/

For info on all the other features check the original version at http://code.google.com/p/io-2012-slides/ and the original readme at http://io-2012-slides.googlecode.com/git/README.html
